			<h5>Graphic designer learning fullstack webdevelopment</h5>
				<p id="about">From graphic design I'm now progressing and learning webdevelopment. Currently taking a webdevelopment intensive course at the <em>New York Code and Design Academy</em>.
				I hope to travel towards a more inventive and creative challenge combined with graphic work.
				Almost all my sparetime is filled with those two furry beauty's above. They're Mr. Trend and Lootah. You can click on their picture and this will bring you to their personal Instagram account. 
				I do a lot of photography, graphic design, walks, bicycle rides, yoga and I would love to go climbing again if I find a partner to do this with.</p>
